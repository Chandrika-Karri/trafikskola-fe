# Trafikskola Frontend

This is the frontend part of my Trafikskola project.  
It was built with React to practice building a real web interface for a driving school app.

The frontend connects to a backend API (Spring Boot) to show and manage data.

---

## 🧠 What this project does

This frontend provides a user interface to interact with the Trafikskola backend.

With this app you can:

- Load and view data from the backend
- Interact with API endpoints
- Practice frontend logic using React
- See how a real web app communicates with a backend

This project was tested locally and is primarily a learning project.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **React** (Create React App)  
- **JavaScript** (React components, state, routing)  
- **CSS** (basic styling)  
- **Fetch API** (for connecting to backend)  

You can see all dependencies in `package.json`.

## 🚀 How to run locally

**1. Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chandrika-Karri/trafikskola-fe.git
```

**2. Install dependencies**
```bash
   cd trafikskola-fe
   npm install
```

**3. Start the app**
```bash
   npm start
```
This will:
- Start the React app in development mode
- Open it in your browser
- Reload automatically on code changes
- Open: http://localhost:3000 to see the interface and interact with it.

🛠 **What I learned**
- While working on this frontend, I practiced:
- Building React components
- Using React Router for navigation
- Connecting the UI to a backend API
- Handling data fetching and rendering
- Structuring a React project for clarity
